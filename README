ABOUT
=====

PHP torrent downloader for RSS is a script that helps you get torrents that you
are interested in from one or more RSS feeds.  It supports include and exclude
patterns, multiple feeds, and custom location of the downloaded .torrent files.



USAGE
=====

$ php -f torrents.php [custom.ini]

If no INI file specified, torrents.php will look for torrents.ini .  If that is not
found either, the script will terminate with error.
